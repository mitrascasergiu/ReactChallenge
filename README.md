# Welcome to our Customer Onboarding Application

This is where you can start to get familiar with the codebase that we'll work with during our pairing session. As you will see, it is a basic app, a starting point on which you will be required to implement new features, refactor some parts of the code and have code related conversations. 

# Application description

In the world of banking, customer onboarding is one of the most important processes. It is the starting point which enables the (future) customer to benefit from the entire banking services that are provided. The current application consists of a basic authentication process (admin/password), followed by a customer onboarding form (name, email, phone). It also contains a list of already onboarded customers where the user can change the onboarding status of a customer, together with a summary section, where some basic metrics are compiled and presented to the user.
